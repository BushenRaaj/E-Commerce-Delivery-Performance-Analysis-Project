# ðŸ§¾ E-Commerce Delivery Performance Analysis Project

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **e-commerce delivery performance** to uncover factors that influence delivery efficiency, customer satisfaction, and discount effectiveness.  
The process involves cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data to derive actionable insights that can help **optimize logistics operations** and **enhance customer experience**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Evaluate **on-time delivery performance** across different shipment modes and warehouses.  
- Analyze **customer ratings, product importance**, and **discount impact** on delivery success.  
- Develop an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for performance tracking and decision support.

---

## ðŸ§© Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** â€“ Data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation.  
- **Pandas, NumPy** â€“ Data manipulation and feature engineering.  
- **Power BI** â€“ Data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard creation.  
- **Power Query (M Code)** â€“ Transformation logic for calculated columns.  
- **Excel** â€“ Cleaned dataset export and validation.

## ðŸ§± Steps Involved in Building the Project

### 1. Data Collection
Imported the raw dataset (`Train.csv`) containing e-commerce order details, shipment modes, warehouses, product costs, discounts, and customer ratings.

### 2. Data Cleaning (Python â€“ Jupyter Notebook)
- Handled missing and inconsistent values.  
- Removed duplicates and standardized categorical fields.  
- Created new columns such as:
  - `Discount_Percent`
  - `Gender_Label`
  - `Weight_Bin`
- Exported the cleaned dataset as **Cleaned_Train_File.xls**.

### 3. Data Transformation (Power BI)
- Imported the cleaned dataset and refined data using **Power Query (M Code)**.  
- Created calculated columns:
  - `Weight_Bin` â€“ Categorized products by weight range.  
  - `Discount_Percent` â€“ Computed discount as a percentage of product cost.  
  - `Gender_Label` â€“ Converted gender codes (M/F) to descriptive labels.  

- Created **DAX measures**:
  - `Total Orders`  
  - `On-Time Deliveries`  
  - `On-Time %`  
  - `Average Discount %`  
  - `Average Rating`  
  - `Average Cost`  
  - `Total Discount Amount`

### 4. Visualization (Power BI Dashboard)
Designed 2â€“3 interactive dashboards focusing on:
- **Delivery Performance** (Shipment mode, warehouse, and trends)  
- **Customer Insights** (Ratings vs. Discounts, Product Importance)  
- **Operational Overview** (On-Time %, Average Discount, Cost KPIs)  

Added **slicers for filters**: Shipment Mode, Warehouse, Product Importance, and Gender.  
Used **KPI cards** and **trend lines** for easy performance tracking.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Shipments by **Air** had the highest on-time delivery percentage.  
- **Medium-weight products** experienced the most balanced delivery rates and costs.  
- Customers offered **moderate discounts** tended to give higher ratings.  
- Some **warehouses consistently underperformed**, indicating optimization potential.
